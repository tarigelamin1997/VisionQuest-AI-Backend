# --- Core Application ---
streamlit                   # The Web Interface
boto3                       # AWS SDK (The bridge to Bedrock/S3)
botocore                    # Low-level AWS requests (usually auto-installed, but good to be safe)

# --- Configuration & Security ---
python-dotenv               # Loads environment variables (Best practice for secrets)

# --- Data & Analytics (For Phase 2) ---
pandas                      # For displaying data tables/Excel sheets nicely
plotly                      # For creating interactive charts (e.g., "Compliance Score")
numpy                       # Mathematical operations (often needed by Pandas)

# --- Development Tools ---
watchdog                    # Makes Streamlit auto-reload faster/smoother on Windows
